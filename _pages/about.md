            I'm Gabriel, a Master‚Äôs student at Virginia Tech, advised by
            <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/" target="_blank">Dr. Muhammad Ali Gulzar</a>,
            former Amazon Scholar and Google Ph.D. Fellow.

        <p style="margin-top: 0;">
            My research focuses on analyzing HTTP headers to understand how websites track users across the web.
            I collect and examine network traffic data, identifying heuristics that indicate tracking‚Äîsuch as
            value consistency, third-party associations, length patterns, and storage in cookies or local storage.
            I also leverage LLMs to classify headers likely used for tracking, aiming to enhance privacy analysis tools
            and contribute to a more transparent and secure web.

I'm Gabriel, a Master’s student at Virginia Tech, advised by Dr. Muhammad Ali Gulzar (https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/), former Amazon Scholar and Google Ph.D. Fellow.  

My research focuses on analyzing HTTP headers to understand how websites track users across the web. I collect and examine network traffic data, identifying heuristics that indicate tracking—such as value consistency, third-party associations, length patterns, and storage in cookies or local storage. I also leverage LLMs to classify headers likely used for tracking, aiming to enhance privacy analysis tools and contribute to a more transparent and secure web.

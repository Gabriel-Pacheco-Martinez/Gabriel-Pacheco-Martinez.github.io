    I'm Gabriel, a Master‚Äôs student at Virginia Tech, advised by 
    <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/" target="_blank">Dr. Muhammad Ali Gulzar</a>, 
    former Amazon Scholar and Google Ph.D. Fellow.

    <p>
    My research focuses on analyzing HTTP headers to understand how websites track users across the web. 
    I collect and examine network traffic data, identifying heuristics that indicate tracking‚Äîsuch as 
    value consistency, third-party associations, length patterns, and storage in cookies or local storage. 
    I also leverage LLMs to classify headers likely used for tracking, aiming to enhance privacy analysis tools 
    and contribute to a more transparent and secure web.

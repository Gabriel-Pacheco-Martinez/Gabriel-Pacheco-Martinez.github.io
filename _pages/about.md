I'm Gabriel, a Master‚Äôs student at Virginia Tech, advised by [Dr. Muhammad Ali Gulzar](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gulzar/), former Amazon Scholar and Google Ph.D. Fellow.  

My research focuses on analyzing `HTTP headers` to understand how websites track users across the web. I `collect and examine` network traffic data, identifying heuristics that indicate tracking‚Äîsuch as value consistency, third-party associations, length patterns, and storage in cookies or local storage. I also `leverage LLMs` to classify headers likely used for tracking, aiming to enhance privacy analysis tools and [contribute to a more transparent and secure web].
